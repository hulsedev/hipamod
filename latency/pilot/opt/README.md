# OPT

Benchmark the performance of the smaller opt models, and do some quick optimizations using Hugging Face's tools.

## Next steps
- [ ] Benchmark the performance of the baseline model on zero-shot tasks
- [ ] Compress current model and finetune to downstream task
- [ ] Compare performance of compressed model on downstream task

*Before spending extensive amounts of time reproducing evaluation settings, use the quick script [from this convo](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/17653) to get ppl and get vague sense of model performances.*
